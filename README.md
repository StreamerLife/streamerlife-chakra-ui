# StreamerLife Design Kit

Our brand colors and design patterns, inside of an easy to use css design kit.

## Usage
Simply use npm to install StreamerLife Design Kit into your project:

`npm install streamerlife-design-kit`

After installing, import the **"streamerlife.css" file from /dist folder** into your projects stylesheet. 

## Customization
Your Project needs to be able to handle and compile SASS (.scss) files, if you want to modify the default settings of our design kit.

Import the "index.scss" file from /src folder into your projects scss stylesheet.

For example, to overwrite the default font-size property:

`@import 'streamerlife-design-kit/src/scss/index.scss';`

`$font-size: 22px;`
