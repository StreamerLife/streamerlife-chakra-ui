# StreamerLife ChakraUI

Our brand colors and design patterns, inside of an easy to use theme for ChakraUI.

## Usage

Simply use npm to install the StreamerLife ChakraUI Kit into your project:

`npm install streamerlife-chakra-ui`

After installing, import the **"theme" from /dist/index.js** into your project and use it for your ChakraProvider as a theme. That's it! :-)
