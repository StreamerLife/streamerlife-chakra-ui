# StreamerLife ChakraUI

Our brand colors and design patterns, inside of an easy to use theme for ChakraUI.

## Usage

Simply use npm to install the StreamerLife ChakraUI Kit into your project:

`npm install streamerlife-chakra-ui`

After installing, import the **"theme" from /node_modules/streamerlife-chakra-ui** into your project, parse it into **expandTheme** function from ChakraUI and use it for your ChakraProvider as a theme.

Inside of the same root project file, where you use expandTheme and your ChakraProvider, import the nessessary fonts from node_modules (getting installed with streamerlife-chakra-ui automatically):

`import '@fontsource/open-sans/400.css'`
`import '@fontsource/poppins/400.css'`

That's it! :-)
